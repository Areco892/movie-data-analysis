# Movies Analysis - Data Analysis
In this repository, we will do some data analysis on the Movie Industry dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies. 

## Technologies Used
- Python - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Setup
- Download the Movie Industry csv file.
- Import the following libraries: 
  ```
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.style.use('ggplot')
  from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
  
  %matplotlib inline
  matplotlib.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 9)
  ```
- Read the csv file: `df = pd.read_csv('<file_name>.csv')`

## Acknowledgement
This project is a continuation from a video I stumbled previously from Alex The Analyst. However this time, this repository will focus on the technique from the youtube video titled "Data Analyst Portfolio Project | Correlation in Python | Project 4/4" from Alex The Analyst, again very cool stuff! So, I created this repository to practice my data analysis skills using Python and also to keep track of my progress in becoming a Data Analyst.
